        Hi!
        I'm GreatMemorizer and I can help you to remember enaglish words

        How do I do it? Quite simply:
          1) Send to me word and I'll send you translation in response
          2) Push the button "save" and I'll add that word into remember list
          3) Push the button "list" and I'll send your remember list
          4) Push the button "quiz", if you want to take the quiz
          5) If you want to take the quiz now, push the button "run", but you should to know that you must have at
        least 4 words
          6) If you want me to remind you about a quiz, then push the button "reminder" but you should to know that I
        need to know your location for define your timezone, otherwise I'm going to assume that your timezone is "UTC"

        For edit your data (remember lsit, interface language, reminders, timezone) you should to use command /settings

        Commands /start and /help will show this message :)
